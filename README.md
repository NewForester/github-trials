Notes on trials of GitHub and git features

---

Here are notes on essays and trials by NewForester of various GitHub and git features
that he would rather not forget but fears he will not remember otherwise.

There is nothing of interest to anyone else in this repository.

Trial              | Description

local-to-github    | adding a pre-existing git repository to GitHub
